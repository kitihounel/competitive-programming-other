# KTH Challenge

KTH Challenge is a programming competition designed for university and high school students.
Anyone is welcome to compete though. You compete individually trying to solve as many problems
as possible within four hours.

Its website is [here](https://challenge.csc.kth.se). Some time ago, the site was not working. Thank to
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) :heart: we were abble to get the problem statements and
solution slides of some of the past editions.
